# React-Native LinkedIn
Simple LinkedIn login library for React-Native (with WebView and Modal) WIP

## Benefits & others:
* no need to link a native library
* get the token and the expires, you handle your own login with the access_token

# Other library doing almost same thing but with the native SDK
* [react-native-linkedin-login](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-linkedin-login)
* [react-native-linkedin-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-linkedin-sdk)
